This package provides a Python library to facilitate the use of genome,
transcript, and protein variants that are represented using the Human
Genome Variation Society (`mutnomen`_) recommendations.

Features
-------- 

* Parsing is based on formal grammar.
* An easy-to-use object model that represents
  most variant types (SNVs, indels, dups, inverstions, etc) and
  concepts (intronic offsets, uncertain positions, intervals)
* A variant normalizer that rewrites variants in canoncial forms and
  substitutes reference sequences (if reference and transcript
  sequences differ)
* Formatters that generate HGVS strings from internal representations
* Tools to map variants between genome, transcript, and protein sequences
* Reliable handling of regions reference-transcript discrepancy
* Pluggable data providers support alternative sources of transcript mapping
  data
* Extensive automated tests, including those for all variant types and
  "problematic" transcripts

----

Important Notes
---------------

* **You are encouraged to** `browse issues
  <https://bitbucket.org/biocommons/hgvs/issues>`_. Please report any
  issues you find.
* **Use a pip package specification to ensure stay within minor
  releases for API stability.** For example, ``hgvs >=0.3,<0.4``.

Some Examples
-------------

See `Installation instructions
<http://hgvs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html>`_ if you
have installation troubles.

::

  $ mkvirtualenv hgvs-test
  (hgvs-test)$ pip install --upgrade setuptools
  (hgvs-test)$ pip install hgvs
  (hgvs-test)$ python

  >>> import hgvs.dataproviders.uta
  >>> import hgvs.parser
  >>> import hgvs.variantmapper

  # start with these variants as strings
  >>> hgvs_g, hgvs_c = 'NC_000007.13:g.36561662C>T', 'NM_001637.3:c.1582G>A'

  # parse the genomic variant into a Python structure
  >>> hp = hgvs.parser.Parser()
  >>> var_g = hp.parse_hgvs_variant(hgvs_g)
  >>> var_g
  SequenceVariant(ac=NC_000007.13, type=g, posedit=36561662C>T)

  # SequenceVariants are composed of structured objects, e.g.,
  >>> var_g.posedit.pos.start
  SimplePosition(base=36561662, uncertain=False)

  # format by stringification 
  >>> str(var_g)
  'NC_000007.13:g.36561662C>T'

  # initialize the mapper for GRCh37 with splign-based alignments
  >>> hdp = hgvs.dataproviders.uta.connect()
  >>> evm = hgvs.variantmapper.EasyVariantMapper(hdp,
  ...          primary_assembly='GRCh37', alt_aln_method='splign',
  ...          replace_reference=True)
  
  # identify transcripts that overlap this genomic variant
  >>> transcripts = evm.relevant_transcripts(var_g)
  >>> sorted(transcripts)
  ['NM_001177506.1', 'NM_001177507.1', 'NM_001637.3']

  # map genomic variant to one of these transcripts
  >>> var_c = evm.g_to_c(var_g, 'NM_001637.3')
  >>> var_c
  SequenceVariant(ac=NM_001637.3, type=c, posedit=1582G>A)
  >>> str(var_c)
  'NM_001637.3:c.1582G>A'

  # CDS coordinates use BaseOffsetPosition to support intronic offsets
  >>> var_c.posedit.pos.start
  BaseOffsetPosition(base=1582, offset=0, datum=1, uncertain=False)



  # VARIANT NORMALIZATION

  # rewrite ins as dup (depends on sequence context)
  >>> import hgvs.normalizer
  >>> hn = hgvs.normalizer.Normalizer(hdp)
  >>> hn.normalize(hp.parse_hgvs_variant('NM_001166478.1:c.35_36insT'))
  SequenceVariant(ac=NM_001166478.1, type=c, posedit=35dupT)

  # during mapping, variants are normalized (by default)
  >>> c1 = hp.parse_hgvs_variant('NM_001166478.1:c.31del')
  >>> c1
  SequenceVariant(ac=NM_001166478.1, type=c, posedit=31del)
  >>> c1n = hn.normalize(c1)
  >>> c1n
  SequenceVariant(ac=NM_001166478.1, type=c, posedit=35delT)
  >>> g = evm.c_to_g(c1)
  >>> g
  SequenceVariant(ac=NC_000006.11, type=g, posedit=49917127delA)
  >>> c2 = evm.g_to_c(g, c1.ac)
  >>> c2
  SequenceVariant(ac=NM_001166478.1, type=c, posedit=35delT)

Citing hgvs (the package)
-------------------------

| **A Python Package for Parsing, Validating, Mapping, and Formatting Sequence Variants Using HGVS Nomenclature.**

Contributing
------------

The hgvs package is intended to be a community project that
facilitates the reliable use of sequence variants.  Code and
documentation contributions are appreciated!  Contributions are more
likely to be quickly incorporated if they:

* **The default branch is development.** Pulling from default will get
  you a *development* version.  Release versions are determined by
  tags; updating to a specific version (*e.g.,* ``hg up -r 0.3.0``)
  will get you exactly that version as on PyPI.  If you implement a
  new feature, please create an issue first and work in a feature
  branch named like '44-normalization'.
* are submitted against the default branch head (or close to
  it);
* are made via pull requests;
* are in a named branch, named like <issue#>-meaningful-name;
* are narrowly focused on the bug/feature described by the issue
* have discrete commits with good log messages;
* have tests;
* are formatted code with yapf;
* are generally consistent with the (loose) style of the current code
  with respect to variable naming, etc.
