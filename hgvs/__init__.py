"""hgvs is a package to parse, format, and manipulate biological sequence
variants.  See https://github.com/biocommons/hgvs/ for details.

Example use:

>>> import hgvs.dataproviders.uta
>>> import hgvs.parser
>>> import hgvs.variantmapper

# start with these variants as strings
>>> hgvs_g, hgvs_c = "NC_000007.13:g.36561662C>T", "NM_001637.3:c.1582G>A"

# parse the genomic variant into a Python structure
>>> hp = hgvs.parser.Parser()
>>> var_g = hp.parse_hgvs_variant(hgvs_g)
>>> var_g
SequenceVariant(ac=NC_000007.13, type=g, posedit=36561662C>T)

# SequenceVariants are composed of structured objects, e.g.,
>>> var_g.posedit.pos.start
SimplePosition(base=36561662, uncertain=False)

# format by stringification 
>>> str(var_g)
'NC_000007.13:g.36561662C>T'

# initialize the mapper for GRCh37 with splign-based alignments
>>> hdp = hgvs.dataproviders.uta.connect()
>>> am = hgvs.assemblymapper.AssemblyMapper(hdp,
...          assembly_name="GRCh37", alt_aln_method="splign",
...          replace_reference=True)

# identify transcripts that overlap this genomic variant
>>> transcripts = am.relevant_transcripts(var_g)
>>> sorted(transcripts)
['NM_001177506.1', 'NM_001177507.1', 'NM_001637.3']

# map genomic variant to one of these transcripts
>>> var_c = am.g_to_c(var_g, "NM_001637.3")
>>> var_c
SequenceVariant(ac=NM_001637.3, type=c, posedit=1582G>A)
>>> str(var_c)
'NM_001637.3:c.1582G>A'

# CDS coordinates use BaseOffsetPosition to support intronic offsets
>>> var_c.posedit.pos.start
BaseOffsetPosition(base=1582, offset=0, datum=Datum.CDS_START, uncertain=False)
