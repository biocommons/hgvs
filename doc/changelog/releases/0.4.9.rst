Special Attention

A small number of alignments provided by NCBI do not begin at the
transcript start.  These exist in UTA as-is and lead to incorrect
mapping and validation.  Issue `#346 <https://bitbucket.org/biocommons/hgvs/issues/346/>`_ contains the list of 52
transcripts in 37 genes which exhibit this issue; please review prior
results.  **hgvs will now refuse to use such alignments.**

* `#346 <https://bitbucket.org/biocommons/hgvs/issues/346/>`_ (partial fix): ensure that alignment starts at transcript position 0 [`ab402bf020c6 <https://bitbucket.org/biocommons/hgvs/commits/ab402bf020c6>`_]
