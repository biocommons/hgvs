# *hgvs* - manipulate biological sequence variants according to Human Genome Variation Society recommendations

The *hgvs* package provides a Python library to parse, format, validate,
normalize, and map sequence variants according to [Variation
Nomenclature](http://varnomen.hgvs.org/) (aka Human Genome Variation
Society) recommendations.

Specifically, the hgvs package focuses on the subset of the HGVS
recommendations that precisely describe sequence-level variation
relevant to the application of high-throughput sequencing to clinical
diagnostics. The package does not attempt to cover the full scope of
HGVS recommendations. Please refer to
[issues](https://github.com/biocommons/hgvs/issues) for limitations.

## Features

- Parsing is based on formal grammar.
- An easy-to-use object model that represents most variant types
  (SNVs, indels, dups, inversions, etc) and concepts (intronic
  offsets, uncertain positions, intervals)
- A variant normalizer that rewrites variants in canonical forms and
  substitutes reference sequences (if reference and transcript
  sequences differ)
- Formatters that generate HGVS strings from internal representations
- Tools to map variants between genome, transcript, and protein
  sequences
- Reliable handling of regions genome-transcript discrepancies
- Pluggable data providers support alternative sources of transcript
  mapping data
- Extensive automated tests, including those for all variant types and
  \"problematic\" transcripts
- Easily installed using remote data sources. Installation with local
  data sources is straightforward and completely obviates network
  access

## Important Notes

- **You are encouraged to** [browse
  issues](https://github.com/biocommons/hgvs/issues). All known issues
  are listed there. Please report any issues you find.
- **Use a pip package specification to stay within minor releases.**
  For example, `hgvs>=1.5,<1.6`. hgvs uses [Semantic
  Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## Installing HGVS Locally

**Important:** For more detailed installation and configuration
instructions, see the [HGVS readthedocs](https://hgvs.readthedocs.io/)

### Prerequisites

    libpq
    python3
    postgresql

Examples for installation:

MacOS :

    brew install libpq
    brew install python3
    brew install postgresql

Ubuntu :

    sudo apt install gcc libpq-dev python3-dev

### Installation Steps

By default, hgvs uses remote data sources, which makes
installation easy. If you would like to use local instances of the data sources, see the [readthedocs](https://hgvs.readthedocs.io/).

1. Create a virtual environment using your preferred method.

    **Example:**

        python3 -m venv venv

2. Run the following commands in your virtual environment:

        source venv/bin/activate
        pip install --upgrade setuptools
        pip install hgvs

See [Installation
instructions](http://hgvs.readthedocs.org/en/stable/installation.html)
for details, including instructions for installing [Universal Transcript
Archive (UTA)](https://github.com/biocommons/uta/) and
[SeqRepo](https://github.com/biocommons/biocommons.seqrepo/) locally.

## Examples and Usage

See [examples](https://github.com/biocommons/hgvs/tree/main/examples) and [readthedocs](https://hgvs.readthedocs.io/) for usage.

## Developer Setup

The hgvs package is a community effort. Please see
[Contributing](http://hgvs.readthedocs.org/en/stable/contributing.html) to get
started in submitting source code, tests, or documentation. Thanks for getting
involved!

### Install Prerequisites

These tools are required to get started:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/): Version control system
- [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/): Current mechanism for consistent invocation of developer tools.
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/): An extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust.

#### MacOS or Linux Systems

- [Install brew](https://brew.sh/)
- `brew install git make uv`

#### Linux (Debian-based systems)

You may also install using distribution packages:

    sudo apt install git make

Then install uv using the [uv installation instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

### One-time development setup

Create a Python virtual environment, install dependencies, install pre-commit hooks, and install an editable package:

    make devready

### Development

**N.B.** Developers are expected to use `make` to invoke tools to
ensure consistency with the CI/CD pipelines.  Type `make` to see a list of
supported targets.  A subset are listed here:

    » make
    🌟🌟 biocommons conventional make targets 🌟🌟

    Using these targets promots consistency between local development and ci/cd commands.

    usage: make [target ...]

    BASIC USAGE
    help                Display help message

    SETUP, INSTALLATION, PACKAGING
    devready            Prepare local dev env: Create virtual env, install the pre-commit hooks
    build               Build package
    publish             publish package to PyPI

    FORMATTING, TESTING, AND CODE QUALITY
    cqa                 Run code quality assessments
    test                Test the code with pytest

    DOCUMENTATION
    docs-serve          Build and serve the documentation
    docs-test           Test if documentation can be built without warnings or errors

    CLEANUP
    clean               Remove temporary and backup files
    cleaner             Remove files and directories that are easily rebuilt
    cleanest            Remove all files that can be rebuilt
    distclean           Remove untracked files and other detritus

### Testing

Existing tests use a cache that is committed with the repo to ensure that tests do not require external networking.  To develop new tests, which requires loading the cache, you should install UTA and Seqrepo (and the rest service) locally.

    docker compose --project-name biocommons -f ./misc/docker-compose.yml up

IMPORTANT: Loading the test caches is currently hampered by
[#551](https://github.com/biocommons/hgvs/issues/551),
[#760](https://github.com/biocommons/hgvs/issues/760), and
[#761](https://github.com/biocommons/hgvs/issues/761). To load reliably, use
`make test-relearn-iteratively` for now.
