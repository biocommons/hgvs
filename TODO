Actionable issues are at https://bitbucket.org/biocommons/hgvs/issues.
This file is intended for ideas that need fleshing out.

* 0.4.x
** s/2014/2015/g
** tests: expected value first
** sq-dq
** docs: differences between cgmnrp

** 239: exon finder uses:
- vince
- normalization
- intervalmapper


* 0.5.0 aspirations / considerations

** ref, alt = '' or None?, document it!

** GRCh38 + LRG

** primary_assembly -> assembly

** relative imports

** standardize variable naming; var_x, x_var, var

** complex variants (compound, phased, mosaic, chimeric)

** Transcript Mapper simplification
*** Intervals should probably be of one of two types: simple and complex.
All mapping functions should accept and return one of those types.

*** Eliminate duplicate code.

** Merge VariantMapper and EasyVariantMapper

** SeqDB



* Ideas

** Use sequence assertions exclusively internally
i.e., seq, start, end, alt
from which derive human HGVS expressions

** snake diagram

** shared biocommons exceptions

** Separate code that fetches data from code that uses it.
E.g., TranscriptMapper fetches data and performs the mappings.
Consider initializing with fetch *results* instead.

** Make AA positions more like NA

** VariantTool(hdp, assy, aln_method)
validate
var_x_to_y (x_to_y)
var_to_y (to_y)
replace_reference
normalize -> shuffle, rewrite, replace ref
lift_to
pos_x_to_y
describe_region(cvar) -> e.g., {'start': 'exon 5', 'end': "3' UTR", 'span': 'exon 5..3' UTR'}
extractor(ac, interval, alt) -> var
as_vcf_ref_alt(var) -> ac, start, end, ref, alt
variant_equality
gcn context

** parse and add gene name

** fill/strip/replace/validate ref

** 3 tiers: sequence assertion, HGVS ref alt, HGVS logical (dup, repeat, inv)

** Use pyinter for intervals

** support py3

** BUG: grammar: ins must require interval

** variant -> sequencevariant
