** hgvs_invitae
- copyN, etc

** split gmn_ in grammar for parity
- at least make all gmn rules distinct, to match c,r,p

** implement dup

** set uncertain p. in hgvsctop


* SOON

* rename uta conn s/db/uta_conn/

** documentation

** grammar tests
...for each rule

** move tests adjacent to code


* LATER

** valideer on hgvs classes

** docs
take new pass at docs

** hgvs.util NC 2 chr & vv

** hgvs mapper

** hgvs formatter
use in lieu of __str__ currently
support options, incl. aa1 or aa3

** hgvs validator

** get entire match string from parsley?
