Actionable issues are at https://bitbucket.org/biocommons/hgvs/issues.
This file is intended for ideas that need fleshing out.

* before release
** release notes w/deprecations
** yapf
** sq-dq
** evm normalize=True
** drop c_to_n, n_to_c?
** normalize: separate fill, rewrite, and shuffle
** tests: expected value first

** 0.4.0 deprecations / 0.5.0 obsolescence
- primary_assembly -> assembly
- consider var_x -> var


* 0.5.0 aspirations
** complex variants (compound, phased, mosaic, chimeric)


* Transcript Mapper simplification
** Intervals should probably be of one of two types: simple and complex.
All mapping functions should accept and return one of those types.

** Eliminate duplicate code.

* Variant mapper simplification
** to_g() method for n,c,r variants?

* Separate code that fetches data from code that uses it.
E.g., TranscriptMapper fetches data and performs the mappings.
Consider initializing with fetch *results* instead.

* Merge VariantMapper and EasyVariantMapper
