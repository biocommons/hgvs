Actionable issues are at https://bitbucket.org/biocommons/hgvs/issues.
This file is intended for ideas that need fleshing out.


* Background changes
** tests: expected value first
** tests: 100% code coverage
** code: sq-dq, yapf
** code: standardize internal variable naming; var_x, x_var, var
** code: relative imports
** docs: s/2014/2015/g
** docs: differences between cgmnrp
** docs: consolidate dev instructions, link from README

* Backward API changes / renamings
** variant -> sequencevariant
** primary_assembly -> assembly
** ref, alt = '' or None?, document it!
** Merge VariantMapper and EasyVariantMapper

* New features (0.5.0?)
** support py3
** REST interface
** complex variants (compound, phased, mosaic, chimeric)
** 166-warnings
** 239: exon finder uses:
** fill/strip/replace/validate ref config option
** parse and add gene name

* Architecture
** Separate code that fetches data from code that uses it.
E.g., TranscriptMapper fetches data and performs the mappings.
Consider initializing with fetch *results* instead.
** Make AA positions more like NA
** Rethink variant abstractions
** Simplify Transcript Mapper / CIGAR Mapper
** Intervals should probably be of one of two types: simple and complex.
All mapping functions should accept and return one of those types.
** Use sequence assertions exclusively internally
** Performance profiling



* Other ideas
** import hgvs... and you're done?

** VariantTool(hdp, assy, aln_method)
wraps most common functionality
validate
var_x_to_y (x_to_y)
var_to_y (to_y)
replace_reference
normalize -> shuffle, rewrite, replace ref
lift_to
pos_x_to_y
describe_region(cvar) -> e.g., {'start': 'exon 5', 'end': "3' UTR", 'span': 'exon 5..3' UTR'}
extractor(ac, interval, alt) -> var
as_vcf_ref_alt(var) -> ac, start, end, ref, alt
variant_equality
gcn context

** 3 tiers: sequence assertion, HGVS ref alt, HGVS logical (dup, repeat, inv)

** Use pyinter for intervals

** grammar: ins must require interval


* remove defaults
* consider to_nc method
* verify replace_reference for del and ins (incl v. excl range!)
* add reciprocal variant option in g_to_c
* add g_to_t and t_to_g
* find TODOs and FIXMEs
